The folder includes the differences of seasonal biomass (absolute number) of the size bins for protists (6), active copepods (6) and passive copepods communities (4).
*for copepods: ALL LIFE STAGES (juvenile + adult)  
First row  : the seasonal biomass difference during the heatwave
Rows 2- 36 : the biomass difference after the heatwave for 9 years

 
cc_A_mean_XXXX 		 : seasonal biomass difference for active copepods for for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn) 
cc_P_mean_XXXX 		 : seasonal biomass difference for passive copepods for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn)
P_mean_XXXX	   		 : seasonal biomass difference for protists for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn)
cc_A_mean_XXXX_cop_only  : seasonal biomass difference for active copepods for for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn) for direct heatwave effects only on COPEPODS
cc_P_mean_XXXX_cop_only  : seasonal biomass difference for passive copepods for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn) for direct heatwave effects only on COPEPODS
P_mean_XXXX_cop_only	 : seasonal biomass difference for protists for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn) for direct heatwave effects only on COPEPODS
cc_A_mean_XXXX_prot_only : seasonal biomass difference for active copepods for for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn) for direct heatwave effects only on PROTISTS
cc_P_mean_XXXX_prot_only : seasonal biomass difference for passive copepods for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn) for direct heatwave effects only on PROTISTS
P_mean_XXXX_prot_only	 : seasonal biomass difference for protists for each heatwave scenario (XXXXX: winter, spring, summer, autumn) for direct heatwave effects only on PROTISTS
seasonal_control	 	 : the biomass before the heatwave scenarios (P_control: protists, Ca_control: all active copeopods, CaA_copepods: only all active adult copepods, 
				   Cp_control: all passive copepods, CpA_copepods: all passive adult copeods).
