This folder includes data used for Figure 5 and Figure SMX. 
Year 0: pre-heatwave steady-state conditions 
Year 1: when the seasonal heatwave occurs
Years 2-9: years after the heatwave. 

SEASON_PlanktonGroup_all_seasons: model output for a seasonal heatwave (spring/summer/autumn/winter) for either Protists ("P), active copepods ("Ca") or passive copepods ("Cp") with the direct effects of temperature on both protists and copepods (active, passive). 

SEASON_PlanktonGroup_all_seasons_prot_only: model output for a seasonal heatwave (spring/summer/autumn/winter) for either Protists ("P), active copepods ("Ca") or passive copepods ("Cp") with the direct effects of temperature of the heatwave only on protists.

SEASON_PlanktonGroup_all_seasons_cop_only: model output for a seasonal heatwave (spring/summer/autumn/winter) for either Protists ("P), active copepods ("Ca") or passive copepods ("Cp") with the direct effects of temperature of the heatwave only on copepods.
